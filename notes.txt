bes model to use 
im not using these rn 
need to use one of these: 

NLTK: Powerful, versatile, good for multiple NLP tasks, but complex for sentiment analysis.
TextBlob: Beginner-friendly, simple interface for sentiment analysis (polarity, subjectivity).
Pattern: More comprehensive analysis (comparatives, superlatives, fact/opinion), steeper learning curve.
Polyglot: Fast, multilingual support (136+ languages), ideal for multiple languages
